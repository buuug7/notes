## Introducing events

#### Introduction

Web pages are all about interaction. Users perform a countless number of actions such as moving there mice over the page, clicking on elements, and typing in textboxes - all of these are example of events. In addition to these user events, there are a slew of others that occur, like when the page is loaded, when video begins playing or is paused, etc. Whenever something interesting occurs on the page, an event is fired, meaning that the browser basically announces that something has happened. It's this announcement that allows developers to "listen" for events and react to them appropriately.

网页都是交互的。用户执行无数次的动作例如移动鼠标，点击元素，在文本框中输入 - 所有这些都被称为事件。除了这些用户事件之外，还有大量的其他事件发生，例如当页面已经载入，当视频开始或者暂停播放等等。当一些感兴趣的事情在页面上发生的时候，事件就被触发，也就是说浏览器基本上会宣布已经发生了一些事情。这些宣布的事情允许开发者去监听并且做出适当的反应。

#### What's a DOM event?

As mentioned, there are a myriad of event types, but perhaps the ones that are easies to understand are user events, like when someone clicks on an element or types into a form. These types of events occur on an element, meaning that when a user clicks on a button for example, the button has had an event occur on it. While user interactions aren't the only types of DOM events, they're certainly the easiest to understand when starting out. Mozilla Developer Network has a good reference of [availabel DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

前面提到的，有许多事件类型，但是最容易理解的是用户事件，例如当有人点击某个元素或者在表单中输入。这种类型的事件发生在元素上，也就是说当用户点击按钮，一个事件发生在按钮上。虽然用户交互不是唯一的 DOM 事件，但是当你开始的时候他们是最容易理解的。MDN 上有很好的参考[availabel DOM events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)。

#### Ways to listen for events

There are many ways to listen for events. Actions are constantly occurring on a webpage, but the developer is only notified about them if they're listening for them. Listening for an event basically means you're warting for the browser to tell you that a specific event has occurred and then you'll specify how the page should react.

有许多种监听事件的方式。行为在网页上不断的发生，但是只有监听的行为才会通知开发者。监听一个事件也就是说你正在等待浏览器告诉你有一个特定的事件发生了并且你将指定如何跟页面发生交互。

To specify to the browser what to do when an event occurs, you provide a function, also known as an event handler. This function is executed whenever then event occurs(or utill the event is unbound.).

通过提供一个方法当一个事件发生时指定浏览器做什么，也被称为事件处理器。这个方法在事件发生的时候执行（或者直到事件被解除）。

For instance, to alert a message whenever a user clicks on a button, you might write something like this:

```html
<button onclick="alert('hello');">Say hello</button>
```

The event we want to listen to is specified by the button's `onclick` attribute, and the event handler is the `alert` function which alert "hello" to the user. While this works, it's an abysmal way to achieve this functionality for a couple of reasons:

我们想监听的事件被按钮的`onclick`属性来指定，事件处理器是`alert`方法用来通知用户"hello"。虽然这样是能工作的，用这种方式来实现这种功能是一种非常糟糕的，有以下几个原因：

- First , we've coupling our view code(HTML) with our interaction code (JS). That means that whenever we need to update functionality, we'd have to edit our HTML which is just a bad practice and a maintenance nightmare.
- Second, it's not scalable. If you had to attach this functionality onto numerous buttons, you'd not only bloat the page with a bunch of repetitious code, but you would again destroy maintainability.

- 第一，我们把视图代码跟交互代码绑定到一块了。也就是说当我们想更新功能的时候，我们只能编辑 HTML 页面，这不是最佳实践并且给维护上带来了噩梦。
- 第二，它不能被扩展。如果你想把该功能附加到很多按钮，你不仅让页面充满了重复的代码，而且破会了可维护性。

Utilizing inline event handler like this can be considered `obtrusive JavaScript`, but its opposite, `unobtrusive JavaScript` is a much more common way of discussing the topic. The notion of `unobtrusive JavaScript` is that you HTML and JS are separate and are therefore more maintainable. Separation of concerns is important because it keep like pieces of code together (i.e. HTML,JS,CSS) and unlike pieces of code apart, facilitating changes, enhancements, etc. Furthermore, unobtrusive JavaScript stresses the importance of adding the least amount of cruft to a page as possible. If a user's browser doesn't support JavaScript, then it shouldn't be intertwined into the markup of the page. Also, to prevent naming collisions, JS code should utilize a single namespace for different pieces of functionality or libraries. jQuery is a good example of this, in that the `jquery` object/constructor (and also the `$` alias to `jQuery`) only utilizes a single global variable, and all of jQuery's functionality is packaged into that one object.

通过如此行内事件处理器被认为是`obtrusive JavaScript`，它的反面，`unobtrusive JavaScript`是一种更常见的讨论方式，`unobtrusive JavaScript`的概念是你的 HTML 和 JS 代码分离以便更好的维护。关注分离显得非常重要因为它把喜欢的代码聚集到一起，把不喜欢的代码分开，促进改变，增强等等。此外，`unobtrusive JavaScript`强调在页面中添加最少数量的 cruft。如果一个用户的浏览器不支持 JavaScript，它不应该嵌入到页面中。同样，为了避免命名冲突，JS 代码应该利用一个单独的命名空间来区别各种功能和其他库。jQuery 是最好的例子，因为 jQuery 的对象（构造器）仅仅用了一个全局变量，所有 jQuery 的功能都被打包进那个对象里面。

To accomplish the desired task unobtrusively, let's change our HTML a little bit by removing the `onclick` attribute and replacing it with an `id`, which we'll utilize to "hook onto" the button from within a script file.

为了完成想要的任务，让我们通过添加`id`属性来替代`onclick`属性，我们将利用一个脚本文件挂钩按钮。

```html
<button id="helloBtn">Say hello</button>
```

If we wanted to be informed when a user clicks on that button unobtrusive, we might do something like the following in a separate script file.

如果当用户点击那个按钮我们想被通知 ，我们可能需要在一个单独的脚本中做一些如下所示的事情。

```javascript
// Event binding using addEventListener
var helloBtn = document.getElementById("helloBtn");

helloBtn.addEventListener(
  "click",
  function(event) {
    alert("Hello.");
  },
  false
);
```

Here we're saving a reference to the button element by calling `getElementById` and assigning its return value to a variable. We then call `addEventListenr` and provide an event handler function that will be called whenever that event occurs. While there's nothing wrong with this code as it will work fine in modern browser, it won't fare well in versions of IE prior to IE9. This is because Microsoft chose to implement a different method, `attachEvent`, as opposed to the W3C standard `addEventListener`, and didn't ge around to changing it until IE9 was released. For this reason, it's beneficial to utilze jQuery because it abstract away browser inconsistencies, allowing developers to use a single API for these types of tasks, As seen below.

```javascript
// Event binding using a convenience method
$("#helloBtn").click(function(event) {
  alert("Hello.");
});
```

The `$('#helloBtn)` code selects the button element using the `$`(a.k.a `jQuery`) function and return a jQuery object. The jQuery object has a bunch of methods (funtions) available to it, one of them named `click`,which resides in the jQuery object's prototype. We call the `click` method on the jQuery object and pass along an anonymous function event handler that's going to be executed when a user clicks the button, alerting "hello" to the user.

There are a number of ways that events can be listened for using jQuery:

```javascript
// The many ways to bind events with jQuery
// Attach an event handler directly to the button using jQuery's
// shorthand `click` method.
$("#helloBtn").click(function(event) {
  alert("Hello.");
});

// Attach an event handler directly to the button using jQuery's
// `bind` method, passing it an event string of `click`
$("#helloBtn").bind("click", function(event) {
  alert("Hello.");
});

// As of jQuery 1.7, attach an event handler directly to the button
// using jQuery's `on` method.
$("#helloBtn").on("click", function(event) {
  alert("Hello.");
});

// As of jQuery 1.7, attach an event handler to the `body` element that
// is listening for clicks, and will respond whenever *any* button is
// clicked on the page.
$("body").on(
  {
    click: function(event) {
      alert("Hello.");
    }
  },
  "button"
);

// An alternative to the previous example, using slightly different syntax.
$("body").on("click", "button", function(event) {
  alert("Hello.");
});
```

As of jQuery 1.7, all events are bound via the `on` method, whether you call it directly or whether you use an alias/shortcut method such as `bind` or `click`, which are mapped to the `on` method internally. With this in mind, it's beneficial to use the `on` method because the others are all just syntactic sugar, and utilizing the `on` method is going to result in faster and more consistent code.

当 jQuery1.7 的时候，所有的事件是通过`on`方法来绑定的，不管你是直接调用还是使用例如`bind`和`click`的简写，它们在内部都是被影射到`on`方法。出于这样的目的，使用`on`方法是非常有益的因为其他都是语法糖，并且使用`on`方法更快和更能保持代码的一致性。

Let's look at the `on` examples from above and discuss their differences. In the first example, a string of `click` is passed as the first argument to the `on` method, and an anonymous function is passed as the second. This looks a lot like the `bind` method before it. Here, we're attaching an event handler directly to `#helloBtn`. If there were any other buttons on the page, they wouldn't alert "hello" when clicked because the event is only attached to `#helloBtn`.

In the second `on` example, we're passing an object (denoted by the curly braces `{}`), which has a property of `click` whose value is an anonymous function. The second argument to the `on` method is a jQuery selector string of `button`. While examples 1-3 are functionality equivalent, example 4 is different in that the `body` element is listening for click events that occur on any button element, not just `#helloBtn`. The final example above is exactly the same as the one preceding it, but instead of passing an object, we pass an event string, a selector string, and the callback. Both of these are examples of event delegation, a process by which an element higher in the DOM tree listens for events occurring on its children.

#### Event delegation

Event delegation works because of the notion of event bubbling. For most events, whenever somthing occurs on a page (like an element is clicked), the event travels from the element it occurred on, up to its parent, then up to the parent's parent, and so on, until it reaches the root element, a.k.a the `window`. So in our table example, whenever a `td` is clicked, its parent `tr` would also be notified of the click, the parent `table` would be notified, the `body` would be notified, and ultimately the `window` would be notified as well. While event bubbling and delegation work well, the delegation element(in our example, the `table`) should always be as close to the delegates as possible so the event doesn't have to travel way up the DOM tree before its hanlder function is called.

事件委托的工作原理基于事件冒泡的概念。对大多数的事件，当页面上发生一些事情（类似与元素被点击），事件从点击它的位置开始，到它的父类，然后到它父类的父类，如此，直到它到达根元素，`window`。因此在我们的表格例子中，无论何时当一个`td`被点击，它的父`tr`也将会被通知点击事件，父`table`也将会被通知，然后`body`，最后`window`。尽管事件冒泡和委托工作的很好，委托的元素应该尽可能贴近委托代表，因此事件在它的处理器执行之前不应该向上传递到 DOM 树。

The two main pros of event delegation over binding directly to an element(or set of elements) are performance and the aforementioned event bubbling. Imagine having a large table of 1,000 cells and binding to an event for each cell. That's 1,000 separate event handlers that the browser has to attach, even if they're all mapped to the same function. Instead of binding to each individual cell though, we could instead use delegation to listen for events that occur on the parent table and react accordingly. One event would be bound instead of 1,000 , resulting in way better performance and memory management.

委托事件直接绑定到元素（或者一组元素）上的两个主要优点是性能和上述事件冒泡。假如我们有一个 1000 多个单元格的表格，其中每个单元格都要绑定一个事件。这 1000 多个不同的事件处理器需要浏览器来添加，即使它们都映射到同一个方法上。代替绑定每一个单独的单元格上，我们可以使用事件委托把事件监听设置在发生事件的父元素上，也就是表格上来处理。一个事件将替代 1000 个事件，这种方式会导致更好的性能和内存管理。

The event bubbling that occurs affords us the ability to add cells via Ajax for example, without having to binding events directly to those cells since the parent table is listening for clicks and is therefore notified of clicks on its children. If we weren't using delegation, we'd have to constantly bind events for every cell that's added which is not only a performance issue, but could also become a miantenance nightmare.

发生的事件冒泡能使我们通过 Ajax 添加单元格，没有必要直接把事件绑定在这些单元格中，自从父表格被添加了对单击的监听事件因此它的子元素单击的时候也会被通知。如果我们不使用事件委托，我们不得不不断的为每个单元格添加事件这样不仅有性能问题，而且会变成维护上的噩梦。

#### The event object

In all of the previous examples, we've been using anonymous functions and specify an `event` argument with that function. Let's change it up a little bit.

```javascript
// binding a named function
function sayHello(event) {
  alert("hello.");
}
$("#helloBtn").on("click", sayHello);
```

In this slightly different example, we're defining a function called `sayHello` and then passing that function into the `on` method instead of an anonymous function. So many online examples show anonymous functions used as event handlers, but it's important to realize that you also pass defined functions as event handlers as well. This is important if different elements or different events should perform the same functionality. This helps to keep you code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

在这个稍微不同的例子中，我们定义了一个叫`sayHello`的函数然后传递到`on`方法中用来替代匿名函数。许多在线的例子向我们展示了匿名函数作为事件处理器的用法，但重要的是要认识到，你也可以把定义好的函数作为事件处理器传递进去。如果不同的元素和不同的事件执行相同的功能，那么这一点很重要。这样帮助你保持代码的[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)。

But what about that `event` argument in the `sayHello` function - what is it and why does it matter? In all DOM event callbacks, jQuery passes an event object argument which contains information about the event, such as precisely when and where it occurred, what type of event it was, which element the event occurred on, and a plethora of other information. Of course you don't have to call it `event`; you could call it `e` or whatever you want to, but `event` is a pretty common convention.

但是在`sayHello`函数中的`event`参数 - 它是什么，它重要吗？ 在所有 DOM 事件回调函数中，jQuery 传递了一个包含事件信息的对象，例如什么时候什么地方它发生的，事件是何种类型的，事件发生在哪个元素上，还有其他许多信息。当然你可以不称为它`event`，你可以叫它`e`或者任何你想起的名字都可以，但是`event`是一个常见的约定。

If the element has default functionality for a specific event (like a link opens a new page, a button in a form submits the form, etc.), that default functionality can be canceled. This is often useful for Ajax requests. When a user clicks on a button to submit a form via Ajax, we'd want to cancel the button/form's default action (to submit it to the form's `action` attribute), and we would instead do an Ajax request to accomplish the same task for a more seamless experience. To do this, we would utilize the event object and call its `.preventDefault()` method. We can also prevent the event from bubbling up the DOM tree using `.stopPropagation()` so that parent elements aren't notified of its occurrence (in the case that event delegation is being used).

如果元素对一个特定的事件有一个默认的行为（类似于打开一个新页面的链接，提交表单的一个按钮等等。）,这种默认的行为应该被取消掉。对 Ajax 请求来说是非常有用的。当用户通过 Ajax 来提交一个表格的时候，我们想取消掉按钮、表单的默认行为，我们可以通过使用 Ajax 无缝隙的完成同样的任务。为了做这个，我们调用事件对象的`.preventDefault()`方法。我们也可以使用`.stopPropagation()`方法来阻止事件冒泡到上层 DOM 树以便发生事件的父元素不会被通知。

```javascript
// preventing a default action from occurring and stopping the event bubbling
$("form").on("submit", function(event) {
  // prevent the form's default submission
  event.preventDefault();

  // prevent event from bubbling up DOM tree, prohibiting delegation
  event.stopPropagation();

  //  make an Ajax request to submit the form data
});
```

When utilizing both `.preventDefault()` and `.stopPropagation()` simultaneously, you can instead `return false` to achieve both in a more concise manner, but it's advisable to only `return false` when both are actually necessary and not just for the sake of terseness. A final note on `.stopPropagation()` is that when using it in delegated events, the soonest that event bubbling can be stopped is when the event reaches the element that is delegating it.

当同时使用`.preventDefault()`和`.stopPropagation()`的时候，为了更简洁你可以使用`return false`，但是建议只有在同时使用它们的时候使用`return false`，而不是为了简洁的目的。关于`.stopPropagation()`的最后一点要说明的是在何时使用，当事件到达委托元素的时候就可以使用。

It's also important to note that the event object contains a property called `originalEvent`, which is the event object that the browser itself created. jQuery wraps this native event object with some useful methods and properties, but in some instance, you'll need to access the original event via `event.originalEvent` for instance. This is especially useful for touch events on mobile devices and tablets.

事件对象包含了一个叫`originalEvent`的属性也很重要，它是浏览器创建的事件对象。jQuery 用了一些有用的方法和属性封装了原生事件对象，但是在有些情况下，你需要通过`event.originalEvent`来访问原生事件对象。在手持设备和平板电脑上的触摸事件是非常有用的。

Finally, to inspect the event itself and see all of the data it contains, you should log the event in the browser's console using `console.log()`. This will allow you to see all of an event's properties (including the `originalEvent`) which can be really helpful for debugging.

最后，为了查看事件对象的所有信息，你应该在浏览器的控制台中使用`console.log()`来查看。它会允许你查看一个事件的所有属性，这样对调试代码非常有用。
