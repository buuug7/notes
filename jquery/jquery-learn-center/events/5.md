## Inside the event handling function

Every event handling function receives an event object, which contains many properties and methods. The event object is most commonly used to prevent the default action of the event via the `.preventDefault()` method. However, the event object contains a number of other useful properties and methods, including:

每一个事件处理器接收一个事件对象，该事件对象包含了许多属性和方法。事件对象通常用`.preventDefault()`方法来阻止一个事件的默认行为。然而，事件对象包含了一系列有用的属性和方法，包括：

#### pageX,pageY

The mouse position at the time the event occurred, relative to the top left of the page.

#### type

The type of the event(e.g. "click").

#### which

The button or key that was pressed.

#### data

Any data that was passed in when the event was bound.

#### target

The DOM element that initiated the event.

#### preventDefault()

Prevent the default action of the event(e.g. following a link).

#### stopPropagation

Stop the event from bubbling up to other elements.

In addition to the event object, the event handling function also has access to the DOM element that the handler was bound to via the keywords `this`. To turn the DOM element into a jQuery object that we can use jQuery methods on, we simply do `$(this)`, often following this idiom:

除了事件对象之外，事件处理器同样也能通过关键字`this`访问 DOM 元素。通过简单的`$(this)`把 DOM 元素转换为一个 jQuery 对象，通常如下方式：

```javascript
var elem = $(this);

// preventing a link from being followed
$("a").click(function(event) {
  var elem = $(this);
  if (elem.attr("href").match("evil")) {
    event.preventDefault();
    elem.addClass("evil");
  }
});
```
