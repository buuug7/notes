## History of jquery events

Throughout the evolution of jQuery the means of event binding has changed for various reason ranging from performance to semantics. As of jQuery v1.7 the `.on()` method is the accepted means of both directly binding events and creating delegated events. This article aims to explore the history of event delegation from jQuery v1.0 to the present and how each version leverages it.

在 jQuery 的演化过程中，由于各种原因，事件半丁的方式从性能和语义方面发生了很大的变化。到了 jQuery v1.7`.on()`方法被接受，用来直接绑定事件和创建委托事件。这篇文章旨在探索从 jQuery v1.0 到现在事件委托历史，以及每个版本如何使用它。

Given the following HTML, for our example we want to log the text of the each `<li>` to console whenever it is clicked.  
给出下面的 HTML，当它被点击的时候我们想在控制台中记录每一个`<li>`中的文本。

```html
<div id="container">
  <ul id="list">
    <li>Item #1</li>
    <li>Item #2</li>
    <li>Item #3</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>Item #100</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
